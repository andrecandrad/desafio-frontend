                <p>The combined experience i have woorking at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps
                     me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>

                <p>I'm proud to announce that i am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to 
                    <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>

            <div>
                <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.</p>

                <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what i mean.</p>

                <p>"How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts
                     being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.</p>

                <p>I am happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.</p>
